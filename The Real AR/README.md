#  Authoring Tool iOS Application


Please read before using the application:

The code for this application is very well tested and when using the application it should work without crashing.
Under exceptional circumstances if the database schema gets broken by an illegal value the application might crash at the opening.
If this happens the illegal value should be removed from the database manually.
Therefore, please send me an email at berat.cevik.14@ucl.ac.uk so that I can fix it.
Otherwise the application will stop working for everyone.
I will check the application daily to make sure this will not happen.
